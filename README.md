# Jellyfish
Experimenting with image preprocessing for machine learning classification of images.
Based on the Jellyfish dataset from Kaggle (Tanwar, Bandini, Burnsworth, 2024)

Jellyfish images have very diverse textures, transparencies, shapes and so pose an interesting testbed for preprocessing images to enhance classification.
